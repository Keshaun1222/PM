	<p>Welcome to the Star Wars Combine Prospecting Manager!</p>
	<p>Given that we don't have a full database of planets, we allow our users to add to the existing list of planets. In order to do so, users can click on the <em>Add Planet</em> tab in the navbar above.</p>
	<p>Since this is a prospecting manager, users can add new deposits they find on an existing planet by click on the <em>Add Deposit</em> tab in the navbar.</p>
	<p>Users can view their deposits, as well as other deposits added to the prospecting manager, by clicking on the <em>View Deposits</em> tab in the navbar.</p>
